# ðŸ’Ž Diamonds Dataset Visualization

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the popular **diamonds dataset** to uncover insights about diamond pricing and quality factors.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Features: carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, dimensions (x, y, z)  
- Rows: 50,000+ diamonds  

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
- Scatter plots (Carat vs Price, with Cut & Color as hue)  
- Histograms & Boxplots (Price, Carat, grouped by Cut)  
- Bar plots (Average Price by Cut)  
- Pie chart (Distribution of Cut)  
- Heatmaps (Correlation matrix of numeric features)  
- Pairplots (relationships between features)  

## ðŸ›  Tools
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## ðŸš€ Key Takeaways
- Carat strongly correlates with price  
- Diamond cut and color significantly impact pricing  
- Advanced visualization styles (whitegrid, dark, talk) were used for better insights
